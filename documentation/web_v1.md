<sub> A web design project cannot be successful until you have defined what “success” actually means. </sub>

What’s the value of this website for you and your business?
* software engineer

What do you want the website to achieve?
* Show my skills 

How do you want to measure the website’s success?
* numbers of repository clicking
* Google Analytics

Is the website an essential part of your business? Or is the website a place to provide information on the company, an extension of the brand (microsite), or a side project?
* It is a part of personal project
* portfolio

Who is the target audience? Who will visit the website?

## 5. Respect Web Standards
	DO NOT MESS UP THE FUNCTIONS

## 6. Make Navigation Simple
    follow regular navigation

## 7. Focus on Mobile
    easy to access and simple view

## 8. Don’t Disregard Typography
Please notice how the choice of fonts, colors, spacing, etc. plays a role in the overall look and feel of the whole page, and works well on both a desktop and mobile.

## 9. Deliver in Batches
Do not design solitude. Do not build behind closed doors! 
Divide the project in two or three main parts, based on the complexity of the project, and deliver those pieces according to the set schedule.
